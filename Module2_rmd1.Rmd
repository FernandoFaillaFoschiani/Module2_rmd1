## R Markdown

### This is a level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

here is a link to google [GOOGLE](http://google.com)

Here is word in **bold** and another world in __bold__.

Here is a word in *italics* and another word in _italics_.

When we compile our document, we are using the `rmarkdown` package.

Here is an example of a non-numbered list:

* Breakfast:
    - food
        + eggs
        + toast
        + bacon
    - drink
        + apple juice
* Lunch
    - taco
*Dinner
    - baked chicken
    - brocoli
    - rice

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure2, fig.width= 5, fig.height=5}

plot(pressure)

```

## Insert Tables

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars),
             caption = "Top 6 rows of cars dataset")
```


## Insert an equation

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x $$

## Insert Images

Here is an image inserted

## Insert an animated gif and Video


## Insert text with some footnotes

Here is footnote reference [^1] and another [^longnote]

Here is an inline footnote ^[Inline notes are easier to write, since you dont have to pick an identifier and move down to type]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.
[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.
